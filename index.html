                    <p>
                        &emsp;The Bachelor of Innovation is an interdisciplinary undergraduate program. The BI™ is a family of degrees, much like 
                        a bachelor of science or a bachelor of arts.  It is a very structured program that consists of an Innovation Core, a 
                        Cross-Discipline Core, a major field of study, general education courses and Compass Curriculum requirements.  The 
                        Cross-Discipline Core helps to ensure the breadth needed for innovation.  Compass Curriculum requirements are mostly 
                        fulfilled by the Innovation Core courses.  General education requirements are determined by the College and department 
                        in which the major is offered. <br>

                        &emsp;The Innovation Core courses are geared toward developing skills in innovation and entrepreneurship.  A key component 
                        is multi-disciplinary team activities over the sophomore, junior and senior years.<br>

                        &emsp;Each Cross-Discipline Core is a concentration of five courses from one “cross over” area outside of the designated major.  
                        Students select one Cross-Discipline Core to complement their education and career goals.  The courses provide basic 
                        knowledge, appreciation and experience what professionals in that area do, and sufficient background to effectively 
                        interact in that domain.

                    <p>
                        &emsp;As a young child, my parents would always share their stories of coming to this country and sharing the difficulties that 
                        they encountered. My mother came to the United States at a pretty young age. She was able to complete her middle school 
                        and high school education and although it seems she had an easy upbringing, she was also one out of ten siblings. Her 
                        father was not in her life and my grandmother was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The brain tumor was so severe that she was 
                        only given 5 years of life.<br>
                
                        &emsp;My mother became the head of the household juggling school, cooking, cleaning, managing her younger siblings, and taking 
                        care of her mother. This caused my mother to grow up faster and become hyper-focused on making sure everything was completed 
                        a certain way and was always the main organizer of the family. My grandmother went on to live for twenty-five years with her 
                        brain tumor and the aid of my mother and aunt.<br>
                
                        &emsp;My father on the other hand was handed over at a young age to his very strict grandparents who then put him to work at the 
                        age of thirteen. He did not have the opportunity to complete middle school or high school. My father comes from an indigenous 
                        town where he was mainly working in fields and working with cattle or anything that was asked of him. Once he turned twenty-three, 
                        he started his dangerous journey to the United States with his older brother and landed in California.<br>
                 
                        &emsp;He struggled to find a place to live and had to separate from his brother and would end up working in construction and renting to 
                        sleep on a coworker’s couch. There were nights when food was not an option, or the only thing available would be a tortilla with 
                        lime and salt and that would be the only thing to keep him going through the night. My dad has achieved the most in life by nurturing 
                        relationships with those who gave him the opportunity to grow in life. I know that the amazing family that let him and my uncle rent 
                        out their garage is a family we still go visit today and are able to remember the many stories they have made together.<br>
             
                        &emsp;Hearing the struggles that my parents faced and being able to experience the great success they have accomplished, allows me to really 
                        push myself to work harder to show my parents that appreciation for everything they had to encounter. These stories can be applied to my 
                        life as a representation of where my family came from, along with being able to acknowledge the great opportunities I have been given 
                        due to their sacrifices. I have the honor of being a first-generation college graduate in my family with the support of my parents.<br>
                 
                        &emsp;My parents have always told me to go after what I wanted in life and to explore the opportunities that were presented to me. Their stories 
                        remind me that although I may encounter what I would think is a huge roadblock on my road to success, I will be able to overcome it and 
                        come out stronger.<br>
                 
                        &emsp;The story of the upbringing my parents had encourages me to achieve the most I can in this lifetime and to give back to them. My parents 
                        have the dream of being able to retire and build a home in my father’s hometown along with my mother’s hometown. I want them to be able 
                        to leave and enjoy their time knowing that they gave me and my siblings and the greatest amount of support and encouragement to pursue 
                        our dreams. Their story will always have an impact on how I pursue problems thrown at me and the roadblocks I may encounter.<br>
                   
                        &emsp;Going into this crazy world after college, I will be able to use this mindset that was shown to me through my parent’s story to really 
                        push forward no matter what is thrown at me. The importance of making the best of any situation and coming out on top is what we should 
                        strive to achieve. I would like to be able to share these stories and tell my own to future generations.

                        &emsp;Being a woman in one of the most male-dominated career fields is one of the things that I find myself being passionate about. Demonstrating 
                        to others that it is important to stand up for yourself, show up and be present in social groups you wouldn’t find yourself. I, as a Mexican 
                        American, have found myself as a bilingual female in the computer science world and have made my stand and proved not only to myself, but many 
                        others that I deserve to be here, and others should be confident to do the same as well.<br>
        
                        &emsp;As an innovator, I would like to reach a point where I am able to encourage, support, and guide those bilingual computer science individuals 
                        into this world where it seems we were either never noticed or underappreciated. Being able to construct teams and work with students to provide 
                        them with one of the most amazing experiences before going into the industry. To create a workplace that doesn’t discourage those around when they 
                        are having a bad day or not able to understand a certain problem.<br>

                        &emsp;I have had the honor of being able to work in multiple teams throughout my years in the Bachelor of Innovation and will be able to understand the 
                        importance of the type of dynamic this environment will need to guide everyone to excellence. Being able to take a lead and create an environment 
                        with this dedication. To use the structure, I learned in the innovation teams and working with multiple team members with many different backgrounds 
                        and being able to understand how important it truly is to find a balance when working with others is a tool that everyone should know to go into 
                        industry and know how to navigate having to work with so many people. <br>

                        &emsp;Coming from a background where one of my parents did not even finish the sixth grade and the other only receiving a diploma, going to college, and 
                        earning a degree of any kind was a dream on its own. But being a computer scientist as well as an innovator has brought me to a great place mentally 
                        to be able to guide others who may be coming down the same path. Knowing that there is only twenty-two percent of all software engineers that are 
                        women and about 8.1% of that cut are Hispanic or Latinos. <br>

                        &emsp;I would like to use this information to my advantage to demonstrate the need there is to support this group in the software engineering community. 
                        These statistics clearly show how intimidating it could be for someone in this demographic to become encouraged to take a step into the software 
                        engineering field. This will also be incredibly beneficial due to the huge age gap there is from current software engineers and incoming software 
                        engineers. The environment I would like to create will also thrive to build a bridge to help these age gap differences as well as learn to be able 
                        to work with all different types of people.<br>
                        
                        &emsp;As a student, I have craved to have a place with others with the same background as me to have a safe environment where I would not be afraid to 
                        ask questions or take initiative on certain projects. Now, as an innovator, I am encouraged to make an impact in the software engineering field for 
                        all of those who have struggled to find their place on this path and help provide them with the tools necessary to achieve greatness in their lives. 
                        The main goal is to be able to see how much we can make the demographics in the software engineering field change.

                        This is a Snow Day Calculator website, where the user is able to enter their zip code and the name of their school to then be able to see
                        what the possibility of a snow day may be. The website will also calculate a perdiction of the amount of inches the users area may receive
                        to then prepare the user to either have a snow day, or if the day will simply just be cold.
